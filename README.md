# First Person Shooter Test in OpenGL

This is a minimalistic First Person Shooter Game Engine written in C++ with OpenGL based on the Game Institute code written by Steve Jones.

Windows support has been dropped. Currently the codebase is structured to favor MAC builds.  This code could be build in GNU/Linux with little (if any) changes. If you have any question on how to build this project on your operating system feel free to contact me  at  raydelto [at] yahoo.com .
